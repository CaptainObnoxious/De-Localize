# De-Localize
A repository for a reddit bot written in python I'm attempting to develop.

This bot will take an input of a url and attempt to remove localization modifiers.

EX:
https://de.fakewebsite.com to https://fakewebsite.com

Do not click those. They're not real.

I have no idea how to do this.
